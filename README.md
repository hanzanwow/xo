# Tic Tac Toe AI (C++)

A terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in modern C++ with multiple AI difficulty levels, including a Minimax-powered hard mode.

---

## Features

* 3 Difficulty Levels

  * Easy → Random moves
  * Medium → Basic strategy (win/block + randomness)
  * Hard → Minimax AI (optimal play)

* AI System

  * Smart move evaluation
  * Recursive Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning
  * Layered scoring: prefers faster wins, slower losses, and central control

* Terminal UI

  * Clean board rendering
  * Colored output using ANSI escape codes

* Score Tracking

  * Player wins
  * AI wins
  * Ties

## AI Overview

### Easy Mode

* Completely random moves
* No strategy

### Medium Mode

* Attempts to win if possible
* Blocks opponent
* Otherwise plays randomly

### Hard Mode (Minimax)

* Explores all possible board states (Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning)
* Assigns a **layered terminal score** so each tier dominates the next:

  * AI wins     → `(10 - depth) * 100 + positionBonus`  (faster wins score higher)
  * Player wins → `(depth - 10) * 100 + positionBonus`  (slower losses score higher)
  * Tie         → `positionBonus`                        (broken by central control)
* `positionBonus` = Σ(AI cell weights) − Σ(player cell weights), where each cell's weight
  is the number of winning lines through it (center 4, corners 3, edges 2)
* Always selects the optimal move

## Example Gameplay

```
Player (X): 0  |  Computer (O): 0 | Ties: 0
==== XO XO XO====
  X  |  O  |     
_____|_____|_____
     |  X  |     
_____|_____|_____
  O  |     |     
==== XO XO XO====
Enter number (1-9) to place your 'X':
```

## Future Improvements

- [x] Alpha-Beta pruning (performance optimization)

~~- [ ] GUI version using SFML~~
- [ ] Test function $1/3$
  - [ ] Easy mode
  - [ ] Medium mode
  - [x] Hard mode
- [x] Execution time measurement with `<chrono>` (HardMode `findBestMove`)
  - Standalone benchmark: `execution-time.cpp`.
  - Two `HardMode` bots (X vs O) play a full game; every `findBestMove()` call is timed with `std::chrono::steady_clock` (`startTime` / `endTime` / `elapsedTime` in nanoseconds).
  - The match is repeated 20 times — perfect-play vs perfect-play is deterministic, so the move sequence is identical across games and each move position gets 20 timing samples.
  - Reports per-move-position avg / min / max plus an overall average across all 180 calls.
  - Build: `g++ execution-time.cpp XOBot.cpp TicTacToe.cpp Player.cpp -o execution-time -std=c++23 -Wall -Wextra -lstdc++exp`
